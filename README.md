# p5.js-practice
Practice examples which use p5.js
I am presently learning p5.js from the youtube channel "Coding Train". 

To use the examples :
1. In index.html , in the script source tag add the js file you needed.
2. Stylize using styles.css as per your wish.

Note : 
1. index.html contains all the required cdn to work with.  You can update index.html with the latest cdn from the internet
